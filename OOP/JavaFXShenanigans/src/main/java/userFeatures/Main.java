    At the start of the game, Main will load the board with generals on the board and cards in the players hands.
    Then a turnCycle begins. While its one players turn, the other can not alter the board in any way.
    A turnCycle lasts for 60 seconds. Whether the player does or does not do anything, if his turn is up,
    the turnCycle starts over and the other player can play.

    In the beginning of a turnCycle, the player receives one mana. During the turnCycle he can see what moves
    he can do, make moves using mana and read the cards he has. Ending the turn earlier will also be implemented.
